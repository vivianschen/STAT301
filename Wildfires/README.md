# Wildfires

The wildfires dataset (wildfires.csv) describes 350
wildfires that started within a large national park. The origin of each fire is shown below in red.

A number of factors may affect how large a fire becomes. For example, if it starts near a ranger station (green
triangles on the map) at a time when it is manned, fires may be less likely to spread.
Your job is to make two types of predictions. First, you must predict how large a fire will be. In the context
of the data, you will be using all of the variables (except ‘wlf’) to predict the ‘burned’ column.
Second, you will need to predict whether a fire will spread to a wildlife protection zone denoted by the light
green triangle in the northeastern section of the park. In other words, use all of the columns (except ‘burned’)
to predict the ‘wlf’ column.
Both prediction tasks are detailed in the next two sections, followed by a description of the dataset.
Task 1: Area Burned
Task 2: Wildlife Protection
